## Known Issues

1. Link the libfbxsdk.dylib

The fbxsdk use `@executable_path` as install path in MacOSX. We need to replace it with `@rpath` otherwise our
programme can not find the path to load the library. To do this, just run:

```bash
install_name_tool -id "@rpath/libfbxsdk.dylib" libfbxsdk.dylib
```
